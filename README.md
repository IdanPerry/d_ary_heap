# D-ary Heap Data Structure
#### Implementation of d-ary heap data structure.

D-ary heap is a generalization of the binary heap, where d represents
the number of children. further explanation could be found in Wikipedia:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-ary_heap

Most of the methods implementations were relied on the binary heap pseudo-code
routines found in Introduction to Algorithms book by Thomas H. Cormen,
Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein, with d-ary heap adjustments.
